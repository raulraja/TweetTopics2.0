NOTIFICATIONS USE

By using a topic notifications we ensure that the tweets will be stored in the database of our phone. The oldest tweets in Twitter do not appear in searches, this can cause the lost of important tweets to us. With the notifications we ensure  that we always keep saved the last 500 tweets from each subject.

To use the notifications we must consider to make it in searches that have little activity. It would be illogical to store more information of than we can read or save.

If we use the notifications, in the search list an icon will appear whenever you have new messages in this thread with the number of unread messages. If you tick "Use the Android's notifications bar" the program will also trigger an Android 's toast, a vibration, a sound and LED (you can change it in Settings).

Remember you can also change the time interval in which you want to look for new notifications on Twitter on Settings.
